                                <p>As the largest city in Europe, London has plenty to offer in terms of attractions. From the Big Ben to The British Museum, you won’t be short of things to do here. Extremely multicultural, London  makes a great short break away. Here you can see Buckingham Palace whilst having a picnic in St James’ Park and take a walk along the River Thames and cross the Tower Bridge. It’s at night though that London really impresses with its fabulous entertainment and nightlife. </p>
